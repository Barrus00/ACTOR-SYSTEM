# ACTOR SYSTEM
This is an implementation of simple variation about the "Actor model" in C language: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model. <br> 
It can be used to solve some concurrent programming problems. It uses specified in cacti.h number of threads, if more is needed, just simply change the POOL_SIZE value. <br>
